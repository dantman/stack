# Daniel's Web Development Stack Reference

A curated collection of TypeScript-based web development configurations, prompts, and customizations designed to accelerate project setup and provide AI assistants like Copilot with context for new project scaffolding.

## ü§ñ About Daniel

> **Daniel Friesen** is a Canadian web developer with a strong specialization in React and TypeScript. As a T-shaped professional, Daniel is comfortable working across the full stack, connecting end users to domain experts, and diving deep into frontend architecture, design systems, and accessibility. He is a problem-solver at heart, passionate about building robust solutions with modern web technologies.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a reference for my preferred web development stacks and configurations. Rather than being a monorepo of full project templates, it contains:

- **AI Prompt Files**: Carefully crafted prompts for setting up specific stack configurations
- **Stack Customizations**: Detailed markdown files documenting my preferred setups for various frameworks
- **Configuration Snippets**: Key configuration files and best practices
- **Setup Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for initializing projects with specific tech stacks

The primary goal is to provide AI assistants (like GitHub Copilot) with rich context when setting up new projects, while also serving as a personal reference and being useful to other developers curious about modern TypeScript-based development workflows.

## Stack Philosophy

I'm a polyglot developer who chooses stacks based on what best fits each project's requirements. While I have specialties where I'm faster and more experienced, I enjoy exploring new technologies that have matured enough for production use.

**Current Focus Areas:**

- TypeScript-first development across all layers
- Modern React patterns and architecture
- Type-safe database interactions
- Serverless-first deployment strategies
- Cross-platform mobile development (PWA, Capacitor, React Native)
- Accessibility and UX optimization

## AI-Assisted Development

AI has become an integral part of my development workflow, particularly for organization, documentation, and accelerating routine tasks. This repository itself exemplifies this approach‚Äîusing AI to transform disorganized notes into structured, readable documentation.

While AI enhances my productivity and considerably enhances the polish of my communication, my core engineering and explanation abilities remain independent of these tools‚Äîjust don't expect this level of polish in my unassisted writing or anxiety-riddled speech!

### AI Tools in My Workflow

- **Kagi Assistant**: Primary AI for research, knowledge discovery, and general problem-solving
- **GitHub Copilot**: Code assistance, Next Edit Suggestions, and quick information lookup
- **Gemini**: Specialized tasks requiring specific capabilities

### How This Repository Leverages AI

This repository serves as an **AI knowledge source** in two key ways:

1. **Prompt Files**: Reusable prompts that I copy into personal collections or project-specific prompt folders
2. **Reference Documentation**: Structured markdown files that AI can read and reference when setting up new projects

Many of these prompt files are actually **crafted by AI**‚Äîcreated through interactive sessions with Copilot where I work through a task, then ask it to distill the process into a reusable prompt for future use.

### AI Philosophy & Best Practices

**Treating AI with Respect**: Large language models are trained on human writing patterns, so approaching them with the same politeness and respect you'd show a human colleague consistently yields better results.

**Understanding AI's Strengths**: AI excels at tasks humans have already solved and documented‚Äîlooking up solutions, executing established patterns, and handling mundane or tedious work. It's particularly valuable for:
- Organizing scattered thoughts into coherent documentation
- Finding knowledge you can describe but can't easily search for
- Writing text that follows human communication patterns

**Recognizing Limitations**: AI cannot handle complex architectural thinking or engineering decisions that require deep reasoning. It's like switching to a formula racecar‚Äîif you know how to steer at speed, it can make you magnitudes faster. But without proper guidance and experience, you'll crash harder than you would have otherwise.

**The ADHD Advantage**: For those of us with ADHD-spectrum traits who struggle with traditional writing, AI serves as an invaluable translation layer‚Äîconverting disorganized notes and thoughts into clear, structured communication.

> **Note**: This very section (and much of this README) exemplifies this approach‚Äîwhile written by Claude, it faithfully represents my thoughts because rather than giving a brief "write something like this" prompt, I provided my full, disorganized thoughts at similar length to what you're reading. The AI served as an editor and organizer, not a content creator. üòÖ Claude's words, not mine!

1. **Use the Complete Setup Prompt**: Copy the [workspace setup prompt](tooling/WorkspaceSetup.prompt.md) and paste it into your AI assistant for automatic project configuration
2. **Reference Specific Configurations**: Link to individual configuration files when you need specific setup instructions
3. **Adapt to Your Needs**: The configurations serve as starting points that can be customized for specific project requirements

### For Developers

Each configuration file includes:
- **Setup instructions**: Step-by-step installation and configuration
- **Configuration examples**: Copy-pasteable code snippets
- **Best practices**: Explanations of why certain choices were made
- **Customization notes**: How to adapt configurations for different use cases

### Quick Start

For a new TypeScript project, the fastest way to get started is to use the [workspace setup prompt](tooling/WorkspaceSetup.prompt.md) with an AI assistant. This will configure:

- Package.json scripts for TypeScript and formatting
- Prettier with EditorConfig
- VS Code workspace settings and tasks
- MCP server integration for enhanced AI capabilities
- Optional Dependabot for automated dependency updates
